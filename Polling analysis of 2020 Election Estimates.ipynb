    "eBay's current system of measuring productive seller feedback and seller quality are biased (highly skewed), are generally hard for eBay buyers to interpret, and make it near impossible to accurately tell whether a seller is reliable or not. By creating a new, less biased metric to better capture seller quality that leverages the fact that buyers who had a negative experience with a seller are less likely to leave a negative review, the authors offer an improvement to eBay's reputation feedback system which more accurately quantifies the quality of eBay sellers."

    "Yes, it's a problem that most ratings are positive because it makes it harder for buyers to confidently assume that a positively-rated seller is a reliable seller. This problem arises in part because eBay's measurement of seller quality is an example of ambiguous concept-to-measure mapping: the current metric fails to encorporate the numerous and complex factors that influence seller quality/reputation on eBay. The main reason that this inflation of positive ratings is a problem is the high amount of differential nonresponse seen here: the buyers who had negative experiences with eBay sellers are less likley to leave a negative rating about their bad experience, thus inflating the positive ratings that already exist on the seller's profile.

The measurement may not have perfectly matched our construct because there is no reliable way to measure attention (even from self disclosure: risk of social desirability).

These voters are less likely to vote for Hillary, more likely to vote for Trump, but most likely to vote for neither Trump or Hillary. This important fact is currently unaccounted for in our methods and should be accounted for in order to capture the true weighted polling averages across party, race and education. For a large portion of these demographic groups, the polling results we used in our methods to estimate final polling averages only comes from a select group of voter types; we are missing data that should be included to account for the uncertainty that is being ignored in our methods right now. We can focus particularly on those voters who reported Refused for party, race and gender categories- or those who voted 'do not know' or 'someone else' as candidate- to run a logistic regression model and try to use other features of the voter (location, employment type, etc.) to predict who they will vote for, even if they reported that they do not know themselves. This could help us quantify our uncertainty in a loose way, and then we can then incorporate it into our methods to try to accurately predict final polling average. Having data that is more representative of our true population would help our estimates be more accurate."

Donald Trump seems to be the favored candidate after the uncertain voters, and Hillary clinton is favored in the older population. This plot clearly shows that the polling results used in our methods in Part B only come from 4 out of the 8 columns in this plot -- we are missing data and failing to account for the other valuable half of this data by leaving out Refused voters."

Similarly, you can weight each refused category by the polling percent within all of the refused and multiply it by refused group's population proportion in dfpoll to include the refused responses in the final polling estimate, but it would probably be best to do 2-dimensional marginal distribution weighting in order to account for discrepancies plotted above."

These voters likely represent the population of 'Shy Trumpe voters' who voted during the 2020 election but failed to report their Trump votes in earlier polls. There are other variables that affect whether a voter reports their vote in a poll or in an actual election, such as social network influence in a given area, and this is important to measure especially in polling data within one location (Florida in this dataset)."

    "The median is considered the best measure of central tendency because it is 'it is unaffected by extreme outliers or non-symmetric distributions of scores' (source linked below). Additionally, most of the estimates favored Hillary to win, which isn't accurate in retrospect, but those are what the data shows after our weighting techniques. I do believe that better weighting techniques will yield a better single estimate."

    "I would say that I'm not fully confident in my final estimate. I say this because I don't have real polling data from the 2020 election in this section of Florida so I can't calculate the accuracy of our weighting methods. Doing this comparison between estimates and real averages would check how far off our polling estimates were, but also give us a metric for how representative our sample is from the actual population distribution. Although this isn't possible in a real polling estimation case, there will always be uncertainty any time you are trying to predict some outcome. One major reason I don't have much confidence in our polling estimate is because of the amount of uncertainty injected through the refused answers and 'do not know' or 'will not vote' answers. If we find a way to measure and minimize this  uncertainty of answers within the dataset, then we can better estimate the final polling average and minimize our overall uncertainty after weighted averaging calculations."
